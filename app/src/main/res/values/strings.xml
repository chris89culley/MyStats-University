    <!--The Data fragment-->
    <string name="data_intro">This section explains where the MyStats Application collects the information and how it is used. The application stores the information in firebase database and returns any relevant complete course sets. </string>
    <string name="hesa">The main amount of information is collected by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) and stored in a database on the HESA website. It receives the information mainly from the different university in which course it is displaying the information about. This agency collects as much information as it can about each course, some courses however have certain pieces of information missing. MyStats only shows courses with complete information. www.hesa.ac.uk</string>
    <string name="national_student_survey"> The MyStat app uses data from the National Student Survey to collect satisfaction information about the different courses from the students, this is done by Ipsos MORI. This information is collected through a questionnaire containing 22 questions and an additional 6 questions for NHS students. If the questionnaire hasn’t been completed by 10 students on a course, then the information isn’t included. For more information please visit the NSS website at http://www.thestudentsurvey.com</string>
    <string name="dlfh">The Destination of Leavers from Higher Education is used to find the information about people who have recently left university.

    <!--Choosing your course fragment-->
    <string name="ucas_tips_choosing_course_intro">The choice of course is a key decision in anyone’s life with over 37000 courses offered across 350 different universities just starting out can be overwhelming. Below are some tips in how to choose the course right for you, followed by ways to test this choice to determine if you have made the right decision. </string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_hobby">Hobby: Research shows that intrinsically motivating work makes people a lot happier than a big pay cheque so why not pursue a course in the thing you do for fun, your hobby. Whether that’s computer games, gardening, crafts or cooking its worth exploring courses that incorporate your passion rather than concentrating on earning potential alone.  </string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_entry_requirments">Entry requirements: Students often make the mistake of being overly pessimistic or optimistic with their grade expectations, the best way to counter this pitfall is to select courses with a range of entry requirements both high and low to negate the risk of upset come results day. </string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_location">Location: The choice of location is as important as the course itself, this largely depends on individual circumstances so here are some questions you could ask yourself before settling on a location;</string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_location_q1">Is it important for you to be close to your family? If so how close?</string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_location_a1">Graduate employment research has evidenced that students who leave home develop self-sufficiency sooner and therefore have potentially better job prospects than those who stay with family which is worth bearing in mind before you settle for ironed shirts and dinners on the table.</string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_location_q2">What are the transportation times back home, is it an expensive route? </string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_location_a2">A student rail or coach card will be a very sensible long-term investment and can make a great Christmas present from your family or friends, you may even find your bank will give you one free of charge when you move to a student account.</string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_location_q3">Are you prepared for the city life if you are from the country and vise versa if you are from the big city would you be happy to give that up for a rural setting? </string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_location_a3">Your time at university will be an opportunity for you to pursue your interests in a way you may never be able to again; so it is important that you’ll be able to access facilities enabling you to explore these interests. </string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_location_q4">What about your budget, would you need to get a job to help fund your studies at that location?</string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_location_a4">The cost of living varies throughout the country, aside from London the more expensive areas are still given the same student loan payments, meaning it is worth considering areas in the North of the country to take advantage of cheaper rents and nights out.  </string>

    <!--Personal Statement Fragment-->
    <string name="ucas_tips_personal_statement_intro">If you are applying for a course through UCAS you are going to have to write a personal Statement. Now this can be a daunting task and is something all University admissions officers take very seriously. It could mean getting onto the course of your dreams, or not getting onto any courses at all. Well now that you are paying attention, here are some great tips to get you started.</string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_opening_paragraph">The opening Paragraph: Use the first paragraph to really grab the attention of whoever is reading this. Remember these people see allot of personal statements so they probably already know if one is good or bad from the first sentence never mind the first paragraph.</string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_take_your_time">Take your time: Start your personal statement early, this will give you plenty of time to make amendments read it through get it checked by your peers, teachers, parents or any advisors you may see.</string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_be_excited">Be Excited: Universities read hundreds if not thousands of different students’ personal statements. Make yours stand out by showing your enthusiasm get them to feel exactly how excited you are to go and do their course.</string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_be_positive">Be Positive: Don’t talk about how hard your life has been this isn’t the Xfactor and unfortunately won’t get you any extra votes. Talk positive about why you think you will enjoy the course and what makes it right for you. </string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_be_prepared">Be Prepared: You need to show how your life has built up and prepared you to do this specific course state. If your current subjects relate to your chosen course mention them tell them how you took them to prepare you for the course you want to embark on. Mention anything extra activities you may have done that has set you ahead of other people trying for the same course. </string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_sell_yourself">Sell Yourself: Always remember you want to get on the course they aren’t after you. Really sell yourself and all the best qualities that you have. Include little details, have you had a job in the past, you will usually find skills are easily transferable that you can talk about and may just give you the edge against another candidate.</string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_your_expectations">Your expectations: Tell them what you hope to get from the course, talk about Career plans and your future once you have done the course. Say why you think this course best ties in with your aspirations. </string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_your_grammer">Your Grammar: This is a must, Universities do not like people who use slang, have bad spelling or have sentences that aren’t coherent. Make sure you read it to yourself after you finish, then read it again the next day. Get others to read it, allot of services are available to get your personal statement checked. Bad English could make or break any candidate. </string>
    <!--Interview Fragment-->
    <string name="ucas_tips_interview_intro">So, you’ve done it you’ve choose what to apply for wrote your personal statement sent it off and now the universities have short listed you, they want to meet you. This can be scary and for some people their first ever interview. Not to worry here at MyStats we have some tips and tricks to help you along the way.</string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_checking">Check for interviews: A University could send you an invitation directly or it could send you one through your UCAS track. Make sure you are regularly checking whatever means you may be contacted.</string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_times">Times or dates: If and where possible keep with the time and date the university have offered you, if this isn’t possible make sure to contact the university itself directly.</string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_preparing">Start Preparing: Start preparing as soon as you can. Look at what the university wants from you is it a straight interview a performance piece or a portfolio of work, don’t leave this to the last minute. Once in the interview anything can be asked but being well prepared will give you a solid footing. Be ready to talk about your personal statement. If you are in teams be ready to talk about that or anything that is written on the statement you may need to back up.</string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_plan_your_travel">Plan your Travel: Look at maps and plan routes know where the room is on the campus if possible. If you get stuck, then get in contact with the university. Plan how you will get there before the day and make sure to give yourself plenty of time once there to find your way around, you can never be to early but you can be too late. </string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_dress">Dress to Impress: Dress like you want to be on the course. Ask about dress codes if needs be. Some Universities might have a more relaxed dress code but make sure you wear a smart shirt and trouser, not a matching tracksuit.</string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_research">Research: Thoroughly look into your course and the university. Get to know the ins and outs of the course, this includes the content and structure of the course. You may be able to get ahead by specifying which part of the course you are looking forward to. Or ask questions about aspects in which you are unsure. Have some questions prepared. Asking questions shows people that you are keen and want the place on the course. If you can ask follow up questions and keep conversation moving.</string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_be_yourself">Be Yourself: The universities aren’t looking for rigid or boring people, let your personality show. Show enthusiasm about the course and prove that you want to be on it.</string>
    <string name="ucas_tips_practice">Practice: In the end practice will make perfect. Practice in the mirror, to your friends or with your parents. Try and find somewhere that gives mock interviews at school or college. Someone will be willing to help you and it will help to create the confidence to get you ahead of the competition.</string>
